# Hierarchical GAIL Supplementary Videos


## Training videos

Videos are available that log the hierarchical GAIL agent's training at different points in time:

* 12,288 environment steps (1 cycle)
* 135,168 environment steps (11 cycles)
* 258,048 environment steps (21 cycles)
* 626,688 environment steps (51 cycles)
* 1,241,088 environment steps (101 cycles)

The videos depict the agent's interaction with six parallel training environments, with the bird's eye view generated by the environment on the left and the bird's eye view generated by the GAN on the right.

As the training progresses, the generated GAN improves from a poor prediction to an accurate one after 100 cycles.

## Evaluation videos

The evaluation videos show the trained agent at a T intersection, approaching from different directions and comparing the agent's behavior when taking two different actions starting from the same direction.

* Video 1: top-right and top-left
* Video 2: right-left and right-top
* Video 3: left-right and left-top

These videos demonstrate the agent's ability to take different actions at intersections based on the command it receives.

For each route, six images are displayed:

* A top-down view from a fixed camera, showing the intersection and plotting the desired trajectory in blue and the executed trajectory in orange.
* The bird's eye view generated by the environment.
* The bird's eye view generated by the agent's GAN.
* The frontal left camera of the vehicle.
* The frontal central camera of the vehicle.
* The frontal right camera of the vehicle.
